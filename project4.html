    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Grow Up Green is a responsive resale platform designed to make secondhand shopping for children intuitive, trustworthy, and emotionally rewarding. I designed a browsable experience with swipe-style interactions, eco-conscious branding, and accessibility-first choices that highlight sustainability and community impact.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>I owned the full end-to-end design process: research planning, competitive analysis, persona development, wireframing, prototyping, usability testing, and iteration. I also developed the brand‚Äôs color palette, typography, and responsive visual system.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>As a first-time aunt, I saw my sisters struggle to afford baby clothes while managing constant growth spurts and tight budgets. At the same time, my own experience reselling on Depop showed me the gap: there was no resale platform designed specifically for kids that felt easy, trustworthy, and values-driven.</p>
    <p>Parents were interested in secondhand shopping but frustrated by existing platforms. Through early conversations and observation, I identified three barriers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Browsing and listing take too much time.</li>
      <li>Concerns about hygiene and seller trust create hesitation.</li>
      <li>There is little social or emotional incentive to choose used over new.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This led to my guiding question:</p>
    <blockquote>How might we design a secondhand shopping experience for kids that is fast, trustworthy, and emotionally rewarding?</blockquote>
    <p>My vision was to rebrand secondhand as purposeful and modern‚Äîcombining the simplicity of Facebook Marketplace with the positive reinforcement of apps like Ecosia and Forest.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>User Research and Insights</h2>
    <p>I conducted five in-person interviews with parents, grandparents, and caregivers. Each was guided through a simulated shopping task‚Äîsearching, filtering, adding items to cart, and checking out‚Äîwhile comparing the experience to platforms they already used.</p>
    <h3>Key Insights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Trust is essential:</strong> Parents wanted verification of sellers, cleanliness, and authenticity.</li>
      <li><strong>Efficiency drives usage:</strong> 5/5 participants said they would leave if they couldn‚Äôt find items within minutes.</li>
      <li><strong>Details build confidence:</strong> Users requested clearer sizing, condition, and return policies.</li>
      <li><strong>Filters must be simple:</strong> Complex options frustrated 3/5 participants.</li>
      <li><strong>Emotion enhances retention:</strong> Parents felt motivated by sustainability and helping other families.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm buying used clothes for my daughter, I need to know who I‚Äôm buying from and whether it‚Äôs worth the time. It‚Äôs not just about saving money. It‚Äôs about trusting the process.‚Äù ‚Äì Jeniah, parent</blockquote>

    <h2>Persona Snapshot</h2>
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> Zari<br>
       <strong>Age:</strong> 28<br>
       <strong>Role:</strong> Full-time working mom with two toddlers under four.<br>
       <strong>Goals:</strong> Save money, reduce environmental impact, and complete purchases quickly.<br>
       <strong>Frustrations:</strong> Overwhelming layouts, vague product details, and untrustworthy sellers.<br>
       <strong>Quote:</strong> ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs not fast, I‚Äôm not using it. I need to get in and out with confidence.‚Äù</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Storyboard</h2>
    <p>I created storyboards around Clarke, a caregiver persona, to capture both quick and emotional user journeys. One illustrated Clarke breezing through sign-up, browsing, and checkout; the other highlighted frustration on existing platforms and relief when using Grow Up Green.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>I began with quick sketches in Pic Collage to visualize layouts, then created low-fidelity wireframes and prototypes for early testing. Iterating into high-fidelity, I ensured responsive design for both mobile and desktop.</p>
    <h3>Key Design Priorities</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Effortless navigation with minimal steps and grid-based browsing.</li>
      <li>Smart recommendations inspired by TikTok‚Äôs logic.</li>
      <li>User profiles tracking environmental impact.</li>
      <li>Distinct design languages: bold and fast for mobile, calm and structured for web.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Visual and Accessibility Choices</h2>
    <p>I used a forest and spring green palette to align with eco-conscious branding. Accessibility was integrated into every decision: icons were labeled, contrast ratios were checked, and layouts were designed with clarity for all users.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Usability Testing and Iteration</h2>
    <h3>What I Observed</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Navigation was unclear‚Äîusers often skipped the homepage.</li>
      <li>Visual hierarchy needed refinement‚Äîspacing and grouping caused confusion.</li>
      <li>Overall usability was high, but delight was missing‚Äîinteractions felt flat.</li>
      <li>Checkout performed well‚Äî100% of participants completed it without help.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Iterations Based on Feedback</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Clearer navigation labels and repositioned search bar.</li>
      <li>Refined spacing for filters and product cards.</li>
      <li>Simplified dense screens on mobile for faster scanning.</li>
      <li>Retested all prototype flows to confirm fixes.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Final Design and Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>User profile pages with eco-impact tracking.</li>
      <li>Simplified item listing flow for busy parents.</li>
      <li>Responsive layouts optimized for mobile and desktop.</li>
      <li>Smart filtering, personalized recommendations, and wishlists.</li>
      <li>Free item section (covering shipping only).</li>
      <li>Playful, positive design tone reinforcing sustainability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Unlike most resale platforms, Grow Up Green extends beyond clothing, covering toys and gear while tying purchases to visible environmental impact. This holistic approach fills a meaningful market gap.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <p>This project showed me the value of co-designing with users. Observing real interactions revealed insights I wouldn‚Äôt have uncovered otherwise, and testers frequently asked when the app would be available‚Äîvalidating its appeal. I grew significantly in prototyping, iteration, and user story development, and I learned how simplicity and trust can drive engagement in family-focused design.</p>
